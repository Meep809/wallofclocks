This is the Wall of Clocks

It currently shows **all** of the timezones in the world.

Please note: this ***DOES NOT*** show timezones in the conventional format (CST, EST, UTC, GMT) but instead shows them in the cities.

Please refer to [this link](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/) for the cities to use for the great wall of clocks.

Enjoy the website!!!!
